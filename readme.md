# T-Cell subsets neural-network:
The T-Cell subsets neural-network is model that can predict the type and subset of T-cells (T-lymphocyte) based on flow cytometry data.
The model was trained to predict if each flow cytometry event is one of the following: CD4+ Tcm, CD4+ Tem, CD4+ Temra, CD4+ Th0, CD8+ Tcm, CD8+ Tem, CD8+ Temra, CD8+ Th0, a non CD4+/CD8+ living cell or cell debris.
The model was found to predict the test dataset with 99,22% accuracy. 
This means that out of 1,361,486 events, 10,606 events were wrongly predicted.
